title: Technovangelist

This is the technovangelist. You may know me from my work as an evangelist for InfraHQ, currently working on [ollama.ai](ollama.ai). Or maybe you know me from Datadog where I was the first evangelist way back when.

This site has had some history. It was running Gatsby for a long time. Before that, it was WordPress and Squarespace and Community Server and pure ugly HTML. Today it's on 11ty and it's nice and simple.
